This is my first attempt at making a responsive webpage.
You can follow this link to see the original template which I have tried to repilcate with my skills.

I have used HTML and CSS only in this project.
Bootstrap 4 framework is also used to add responsive features to the webpage.

All the images added in the project were downloaded form https://unsplash.com.

I would be happy to recieve guidance from everyone in the community as to how I can make my webpage more better and efficient.
